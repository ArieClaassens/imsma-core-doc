Selecting the Right Web Application in Portal
=============================================

You can create a web app with a map by using a configurable app or [Web
AppBuilder](http://links.esri.com/WEBAPPBUILDER). Different configurable
apps and Web AppBuilder offer various bits of functionality, such as
different layouts and color schemes, editing and identify tools, social
media feeds, side-by-side map viewers, and so on. Choose a configurable
app or open Web AppBuilder from [Map
Viewer](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/create-maps/create-map-apps.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_0A0E43463F304E60B556A670D1CCB6C1),
the [Gallery](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/create-maps/create-map-apps.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_1308883F68B54B34B2DC6E9461874458), [My
Content](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/create-maps/create-map-apps.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_7E1F85B1D480416692F6A9E8EB8F1ED5),
or the [item
page](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/create-maps/create-map-apps.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_218B17C716B845F284D12271209D0088).
Then configure the components and publish the app. As an alternative,
you can [download a
template](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/create-maps/download-app-templates.htm) and
deploy it to your organization\'s web server.

A published web app is based on a map authored with Map Viewer. Any
changes the author makes to the map, including its extent, layers,
description, and so on, are reflected in the web app. If a map that was
available to everyone in the organization is made private (or deleted),
the map no longer appears in the app.

Here are some considerations to keep in mind as you consider which
configurable app to use:

-   Purpose---The most important consideration is the purpose of your
    app. Embedded within this goal is your intended audience: Who is
    going to use your app and what are the key points that you want them
    to take away from the experience?

-   Functionality---What is the critical functionality needed to support
    that goal?

-   Aesthetic---How does the app's layout and color scheme support your
    brand or message?

The following sections organize the configurable app templates and Web
App Builder widgets available in Portal for ArcGIS into categories based
on their purpose. Some configurable app templates or Web App Builder
widgets appear in more than one category, as they meet multiple
purposes.

![http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/GUID-65AE6223-EC47-4C56-9B0A-CD2F96A6A274-web.png](Selecting_the_Right_Web_Application_in_Portal/media/image1.png)  Build a story map
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use these apps to combine authoritative maps with narrative text,
images, and multimedia content. Use these configurable apps to harness
the power of maps and geography to tell your story.

-   [Story Map
    Basic](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/story-map-basic.htm)---Present
    a map through a minimalist user interface. Apart from the title bar
    and an optional legend, the map fills the screen. This is a good
    choice when you want the map to be the focus of the app.

-   [Story Map
    Journal](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/story-map-journal.htm)---Create
    a compelling map-based narrative presented as a set of journal
    entries. This is ideal for creating multimedia stories that combine
    text, maps, images, and video, especially when you have lots of text
    or a rich array of content.

-   [Story Map
    Series](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/story-map-series.htm)---Present
    a series of maps or media. The app can be configured to use tabs,
    numbered bullets, or an expandable side accordion. You can also
    include images, video, and web content in side panels to help tell
    your story.

-   [Story Map Swipe and
    Spyglass](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/story-map-swipe-spyglass.htm)---Compare
    two maps or two layers in the same map. This is a good choice for
    showing before and after imagery or other changes over time.

-   [Story Map
    Tour](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/story-map-tour.htm)---Present
    a sequential, place-based narrative in the form of a series of
    geotagged photos and captions linked to an interactive map. This is
    a good choice for walking tours or for presenting locations you want
    users to follow in a sequenced order.

![http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/GUID-F9F6E833-81FF-45BB-9E02-D1FE0A38574D-web.png](Selecting_the_Right_Web_Application_in_Portal/media/image2.png)  Collect and edit data
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The apps in this category are primarily focused on data collection. The
source of the data can be either a subject matter expert or the general
public. These apps fall into two subcategories: crowdsourcing and
general editing.

Crowdsourcing

-   [Crowdsource
    Manager](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/crowdsource-manager.htm)---Provide
    the ability to review crowdsourced information and update attributes
    such as status and assignment. This is a good choice for collecting
    crowdsourced data across multiple layers and maps since the data is
    collected using apps such as Crowdsource Reporter or Collector for
    ArcGIS. Requires a group that contains at least one map with an
    editable feature layer. Since the Crowdsource Manager app is created
    through a group, it is not available in the map viewer.

-   [Crowdsource
    Polling](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/crowdsource-polling.htm)---Allow
    for collecting feedback and assessing public sentiment for a series
    of proposals, plans, or events. Users are presented with a map and
    list of features containing the details of each proposal, plan, or
    event, including any attached documents. These users can submit
    feedback in the form of votes and comments.

-   [Crowdsource
    Reporter](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/crowdsource-reporter.htm)---Provide
    the ability to collect a variety of crowdsourced issues or
    observations in a single app. This is a good choice for collecting
    crowdsourced data across multiple layers and maps. Requires a group
    that contains at least one map with an editable feature layer.Since
    the Crowdsource Reporter app is created through a group, it is not
    available in the map viewer.

-   [GeoForm](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/geoform.htm)---Provide
    a form-based experience for entering data through a form instead of
    a map pop-up. This is a good choice for users who find forms a more
    intuitive format than pop-ups for entering data.

-   [Information
    Lookup](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/information-lookup.htm)---Provide
    the ability to store the location of each search in a point layer.
    This is a good choice if you want to provide information to a
    community of users but are also interested in gathering their
    location for marketing or other purposes.

-   Survey123-- Provide a form-based experience for entering data
    through a form instead of a map.

General editing

-   [Basic
    Viewer](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/basic-viewer.htm)---Provide
    editing capabilities in the context of a general-purpose mapping
    app. This is a good choice when your audience needs additional tools
    or information about the map to support their editing activities.

-   [Edit](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/edit.htm)---Provides
    focused editing capabilities. This is a good choice when the primary
    purpose is to enable users to edit features and attributes.

-   [Find, Edit, and
    Filter](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/find-edit-filter.htm)---Provide
    the ability to search for features or addresses, filter features
    based on attributes, and create, update, and delete features. The
    filter value is also used to automatically populate an attribute for
    new features.

-   [Web App
    Builder](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/welcome.htm)--
    Depending on the widgets selected Web App Builder can have similar
    functionality to any of the above editing applications. Widgets to
    consider using include the
    [Query](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/widget-query.htm),
    [Filter](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/widget-filter.htm),
    [Group
    Filter](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/widget-group-filter.htm),
    [Edit](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/widget-edit.htm)
    and [Smart
    Editor](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/widget-smart-editor.htm)
    widgets.

![http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/GUID-5E3157FC-5354-45D8-8258-D732A3EC9268-web.png](Selecting_the_Right_Web_Application_in_Portal/media/image3.png)  Compare maps and layers
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These apps are focused on comparing geographic phenomena; the nature of
the comparison you choose may depend on your end goal.

-   [Compare
    Analysis](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/compare-analysis.htm)---Provide
    side-by-side comparison of several maps. For example, you could use
    this app to present the results from a variety of different analytic
    methods, the difference between household income in multiple places,
    or the difference between household income and home values in a
    single location. The app also provides the ability to open the
    pop-ups for the same feature in each map to compare the values.

-   [Local
    Perspective](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/local-perspective.htm)---Compare
    layers within a buffered distance of an address or point. The
    collection of layers can be scrolled through to gain an
    understanding of the variation between the layers within the current
    buffer. This is a good choice for showing data comparing
    availability of resources like schools, police stations, fire
    stations, and hospitals, or for comparing different types of crimes
    committed near an address.

-   [Map
    Carousel](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/map-carousel.htm)---Show
    a group of maps with the ability to autoplay through the carousel.
    This is a good choice even when your maps aren't related but you
    want to have a dynamic presentation of multiple maps on a common
    office display or at a trade show booth. Requires a group.

-   [Public
    Information](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/public-information.htm)---Use
    a swipe tool to hide and reveal a layer within your map. This is a
    good choice for inspecting the difference between two scenarios. For
    example, you could show the difference between current sea level and
    a projected rise in sea level, or visualize an area before and after
    a tornado where the map view may want to closely inspect the
    difference between the scenarios at a large scale. This supports
    configuring one swipe layer and allows you to optionally overlay
    geolocated content from Twitter, Instagram, and Flickr.

-   [Story Map
    Series](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/story-map-series.htm)---This
    is a good choice when you have a large number of maps or locations
    to present or if you would like to include text and other content
    with each map.

-   [Story Map Swipe and
    Spyglass](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/story-map-swipe-spyglass.htm)---Display
    the difference between two maps or between two layers in one map.
    For example, you could show the difference between current sea level
    and a projected rise in sea level, or visualize an area before and
    after a tornado where the user may want to closely inspect the
    difference between the scenarios at a large scale. This supports
    using the swipe or spyglass option by either configuring a swipe
    layer in one map or setting up two maps for comparison.

-   [Web App
    Builder](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/welcome.htm)
    -- The
    [Swipe](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/widget-swipe.htm)
    widget allows you to compare the content of different layers in a
    map.

![http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/GUID-81F83B52-3E22-475E-89A7-94D44FB5AF33-web.png](Selecting_the_Right_Web_Application_in_Portal/media/image4.png)  Display a scene
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

viewer.

-   [3D Data
    Visualization](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/three-d-data-visualization.htm)---Visualize
    numeric data based on a global or local scene. Use with a scene
    containing a feature layer that has at least one numeric field.

-   [Simple Scene
    Viewer](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/simple-scene-viewer.htm)---Present
    a global or local scene with a custom color theme and more context,
    such as a title and subtitle, than the scene viewer provides.

-   [Compare
    Scenes](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/compare-scenes.htm)---Explore
    different scenarios or locations with a side-by-side comparison of
    two local or global scenes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The apps in this category allow your users to interact with attributes
and in some cases other services to facilitate a deeper exploration of
the content of your map to create visual, interactive representations of
your data.

-   [Elevation
    Profile](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/elevation-profile.htm)---Generate
    an elevation profile graph based on a selected line feature in the
    map or a line drawn with the measure tool. This is a good choice for
    showing changes in elevation along a trial or route.

-   [Filter](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/filter.htm)---Display
    an interactive dialog box for exploring the distribution of a single
    attribute or the relationship between different attributes. This is
    a good choice when you want to understand the distribution of
    different types of features within a layer, or create an experience
    where you can gain deeper insight into how the interaction of
    different variables affect the resulting map content.

-   [Finder](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/finder.htm)---Provide
    the ability to search for features or addresses, print maps, and
    share through social media and email.

    an event or a proposal on the local population.

-   [Summary
    Viewer](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/summary-viewer.htm)---Show
    basic statistics (count, sum, ave, min, max) for a collection of
    fields. The app also summarizes data about features in the current
    map extent and configures a filter field to summarize the features
    that meet that criteria.

-   [Time
    Aware](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/time-aware.htm)---Provide
    the ability to visualize the changes in data over time by
    interacting with a time slider. The map can be configured to
    aggregate the data points as time progresses or show data at
    discrete time frames, for example, animating the progression of an
    oil spill over time or showing the variation in crime at different
    times.

-   [Web App
    Builder](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/welcome.htm)
    -- There are a variety of widgets that support the above

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This category of apps includes many options for presenting thematic or
general maps. The apps include legends, descriptions, and other basic
tools to assist users in understanding the message of the map. They also
support a configurable search experience and all but Story Map Basic
support using URL parameters to open the map to a specific feature.
These apps do not have any requirements---they can be used as is and do
not require any map or app configurations. They are good choices when
you want the map to be the focus of the app.

While there are some differences in functionality between these apps,
the primary differences are aesthetic. It is recommended that you
preview these apps from the map viewer and explore the various
configuration options.

-   [Basic
    Viewer](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/basic-viewer.htm)---Display
    a set of commonly used tools within a floating pane. This is a good
    choice for balancing the need for a collection of tools while still
    maximizing the amount of screen real estate dedicated to the map.
    The app includes the ability to toggle layer visibility, print a
    map, and show pop-ups in the floating pane.

-   [Map
    Tools](http://server.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/map-tools.htm)---Display
    a set of commonly used tools in a more traditional toolbar-driven
